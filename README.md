#Mapping The Money
This project explores the financial aspect of the relief effort in Vermont following Tropical Storm Irene.

It's official starting point is within the [TS Irene page](http://www.vpr.net/irene) though the best jumping off point is probably the [FEMA page](http://www.vpr.net/apps/mapping-the-money/fema).

##Project Changes
This project was put together over the course of three months in the summer of 2013. While this repository is dated more recently, the code has remained unedited prior to the creation of this repository.

I'm planning on making some minor changes to the navigation, but will otherwise leave the project&mdash;including my clunky javascript&mdash;largely unchanged.
